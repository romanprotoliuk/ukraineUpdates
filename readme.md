# The Russo-Ukrainian War Updates
https://ukraine-war-updates.herokuapp.com/

## Project Idea/Description 

With this project I want to highlight and update people on what is going on in Ukraine. During these times it is very important to document war crimes against Ukranian people by their opposition and stop misinformation from spreading on the media. This webapp serves as a tool for people to document The Russo-Ukranian war as it unfolds. A user will be able to browse through latest updates on the war and document war crimes as well as misinformation and save tweets to their profle.

## Installation 
1. `Fork` and `clone` repo [UkraineUpdates](https://github.com/romanprotoliuk/ukraineUpdates)
2. Sign up for twitter Developer [account](https://developer.twitter.com/en)
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies 
4. `touch .env .gitignore` files (really important to add your `.env` file to `.gitignore` right away!)
5. Paste your `API_KEY`, `API_KEY_SECRET`, `BEARER_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_TOKEN`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET` from twitter developer portal to you env file
6. Create a `SECRET` key for cookies in your env file
7. CREATE a `PORT` key you want your app to run in locally and paste in in your env file
8. Set up postgres database 
9. Create a database named `ukrainenews` by running `create database ukrainenews` in your postgres terminal for WSL, or alternatively run `createdb ukrainenews` on MAC
10. Run `sequelize db:migrate` to run migrations 
11. Run `nodemon` to start your application. If you haven't installed it, run `npm install -g nodemon` to install it globally

## Tech Stack
* Postgres
* Express
* Node
* Vanilla JavaScript
* EJS
* CSS 

## Choice of API
Most of the data for this app will be pulled form Twitter APIv2, from my experience it has been an effective source especially when it comes to live updates. For this project it will be extremly important to use verified acount tweets.

* learned client / server side difference
* working with queries 
* importance of structuring my app and have a clear road map before I start coding  
* working with databases - I'm still in the process of understanding things better
